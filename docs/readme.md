# DRSM (De-Randomized Smoothed MalConv)

We redesigned the *de-randomized smoothing* scheme to make it applicable for byte-based inputs. We used MalConv as our base classifier and hence, we named our model **DRSM (De-Randomized Smoothed MalConv)**. We are also publishing our **PACE (Publicly Accessible Collection(s) of Executables)** dataset containing diverse benign raw executables.

Please cite our paper if you use our model or data.


## Setup
**Using Conda**

Simply run the command - 

`conda env create -n pytorch_env_smksaha --file environment.yml`

That's it! You're good to go! :smile:
